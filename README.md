# Another_QMK_Mouse
WIP mouse with extra buttons running QMK

There are mice, trackballs and pointing devices using QMK but no mice I've seen with enough buttons in my opinion.
This mouse is inspired by several mice, including the SteelSeries Rival 500, a now discountued mouse featuring 6 side buttons and 4 extra top buttons, in addition to 3 standard mouse buttons and a tilt scroll wheel. https://steelseries.com/gaming-mice/rival-500

No level shifting so only works with 3.3V logic.
